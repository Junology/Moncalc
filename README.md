# Moncalc

The goal of this (personal) project is to establish the following goals with [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4):

  - [ ] implementation of unbiased monoidal categories;
  - [ ] proof of the coherence theorem that every (biased) monoidal category is an instance of an unbiased one;
  - [ ] formalization of so-called "graphical calculus" on (unbiased) monoidal categories.
 
## Dependencies

The project heavily depends on [Mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) project.
As it (and [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) itself) are in Work-in-Progress state, keep in mind that the "validity" of the proofs in the proejct are unstable.
